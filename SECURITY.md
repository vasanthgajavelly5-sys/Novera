# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are developed for the latest version on the `main` branch and the latest published release when practical.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities in public issues.

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately to the project maintainers through the private security reporting tools available on the GitHub repository (this repository is named Novera on GitHub but hosts Lirune Reader):

<https://github.com/vasanthgajavelly5-sys/Novera/security/advisories/new>

Include:

- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce it.
- Affected version, platform, and installation type.
- Relevant logs or screenshots with personal data removed.
- A suggested mitigation, if known.

You should receive an acknowledgement as soon as practical. Please allow maintainers reasonable time to investigate and release a fix before public disclosure.

## Security Scope

Lirune Reader is a local Electron application. Reports involving EPUB parsing, unsafe renderer behavior, unrestricted IPC, filesystem access, imported file handling, dependency vulnerabilities, or packaged-app execution are especially important.

Do not submit copyrighted books or private library files with a report. Use a minimal synthetic reproduction whenever possible.
